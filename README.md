# README

Members of the [OASIS Open Command and Control (OpenC2) TC](https://www.oasis-open.org/committees/openc2/) create and manage technical content in this TC GitHub repository (https://github.com/oasis-tcs/openc2-ap-swup/) as part of the TC's chartered work (the program of work and deliverables described in its [charter](https://www.oasis-open.org/committees/openc2/charter.php).

OASIS TC GitHub repositories, as described in [GitHub Repositories for OASIS TC Members' Chartered Work](https://www.oasis-open.org/resources/tcadmin/github-repositories-for-oasis-tc-members-chartered-work), are governed by the OASIS [TC Process](https://www.oasis-open.org/policies-guidelines/tc-process), [IPR Policy](https://www.oasis-open.org/policies-guidelines/ipr), and other policies. While they make use of public GitHub repositories, these repositories are distinct from [OASIS Open Repositories](https://www.oasis-open.org/resources/open-repositories), which are used for development of open source [licensed](https://www.oasis-open.org/resources/open-repositories/licenses) content.

## Description

This repository is for an OpenC2 Actuator Profile for the software update functionality. Actuator profiles identify the aspects of the OpenC2 language specification that are mandatory and/or meaningful in the context of a given actuator. Actuator Profiles also identify specifiers and options that are unique to the actuator. This repository will focus on the use of OpenC2 to issue commands and parse responses to devices (virtual or physical) whose software can be updated.

Open Command and Control (OpenC2) is an effort to rigorously standardize command and control of vital cyber defense systems. OpenC2 is a concise and extensible language to enable the command and control of cyber defense components, subsystems and/or systems in a manner that is agnostic of the underlying products, technologies, transport mechanisms or other aspects of the implementation.
